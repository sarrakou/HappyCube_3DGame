# HappyCube_3DGame

This simple 3D game is my first attempt at developping a game with Unity and discovering its basic yet interesting components and assets such as: Prefabs, Materials, Animations, and many more. I have created it with the help of Brackey's Youtube Tutorials that I will be mentioning below.
